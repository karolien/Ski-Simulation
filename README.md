<h1> Ski Simulation </h1>

<p> This is a program that was an assignment for one of my computer science papers, involving threading. We had to simulate a ski field that had skiers going up the lift, skiing for a random time period, and then rejoining a queue to get back onto the lift. Furthermore the lift had a chance of stopping randomly (based on a probability set by the user); and when this occured there would be a build-up of skiers waiting to get onto the lift.</p>
<p>This assignment was a great hands-on introduction to understand how threading works and also the importance of using thread-safe data structures to ensure the reliability of your code when using multithreading.</p>
